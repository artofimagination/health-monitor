# Pumped storage proof of concept
Pumped hydroelectric storage is a sort of a battery that uses gravity and solar energy to generate and conserve energy.

This project meant to create a little prototype, so to give some insight on the development quirks on building something similar on a larger scale.

I uploaded all controlling and management software, control statemachine, schematics and some fluid mechanics calculations, but the details of the actual building of the storage structure is not covered here in details.
